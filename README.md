This is a data analysis project on beer reviews, the database was from Kaggle and contains over 1.5M beer reviews from BeerAdvocate.

In this analysis I wanted to determine:
1. Which Brewery has the best beers?
2. What are the best IPA's?

The code is annotated and I decided to use a weighted average measure, so that small breweriers wouldn't domminate.
I also included a visualisation of the best breweriers.
